# RSA-Encryption

This program simulates the computations used for the RSA encryption scheme. It was created to complete CO487 (Cryptography) assignment 3 question 5: (work in progress)

```bash
Alice chooses n = 365867 and e = 67 for the RSA public key encryption scheme.

1. What is Alice's private key d?

2. Encrypt the message m = 2 for Alice. Use the repeated square-and-multiply algorithm for modular exponentiations. 

```
